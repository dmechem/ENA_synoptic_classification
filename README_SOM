SOM synoptic classifications for the years 2013-2018. Classification is
based on the SOM analysis of Mechem et al. (JAMC 2018, referred to here as
M18), which ran from 1979-2012. The SOM algorithm was not redone for these
additional years; rather, we just projected these additional dates onto the
existing classification.

The file classifications_combined.dat contains three columns:
yyyymmddhh node m18_synoptic_classification

yyyymmddhh -- The first column is self-explanatory and corresponds to the
date and time of the ERA-I 500-hPa reanalysis field. Plots of the 500-hPa
field and the normalized anomalies that are used to match the field to the
SOM nodes are available separately.

node -- This corresponds to one of the 25 monthly SOM nodes in Mechem et al.
(JAMC 2018, referred to here as M18). Note that the nodes are *monthly*, so
there are 12*25 nodes in total.  When thinking about the nodes, it is
helpful to refer to the M18 supplement, which shows the SOM nodes for each
month.

m18_synoptic_classification -- This refers to the following subjective
distillation of the nodes performed in M18:
1 = Pre-trough
2 = Trough
3 = Post-trough
4 = Ridge
5 = Zonal
6 = Unclassified
These are listed in the M18 supplement. Note that these are the
month-by-month synoptic classification, so 'Trough' in July means something
different than 'Trough' in January. See the paper for details.
